#+TITLE: Builtin Fixtures

Reusing common fixtures is a good idea, so the pytest devs included some commonly needed fixtures with pytest.

In addition to handling temp files, some built-in fixtures let you:
- access command-line options
- communicate between test sessions
- validate output streams
- modify environmental variables
- interrogate warnings

* Using tmpdir and tmpdir_factory

We can use tmpdir to create files or directories used by a single test, and use tmpdir_factory when we want to set up a directory for many tests

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle test_tmpdir.py
import pytest

def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):
    # tmpdir already has a path name associated with it
    a_file = tmpdir.join('something.txt')

    # we can create directories
    a_sub_dir = tmpdir.mkdir('anything')

    # we can create files in directories (created when written)
    another_file = a_sub_dir.join('something_else.txt')

    # this write creates 'something.txt'
    a_file.write('contents may settle during shipping')

    # this write creates 'anything/something_else.txt'
    another_file.write('something different')

    # we can read files as well
    assert a_file.read() == 'contents may settle during shipping'
    assert another_file.read() == 'something different'

def test_tmpdir_factory(tmpdir_factory):
    # we should start with making a directory
    # a_dir acts like the object returned from the tmpdir fixture
    a_dir = tmpdir_factory.mktemp('mydir')

    # base_temp will be the parent dir of 'mydir'
    # we don't have to use this, this is for illustrative purposes
    base_temp = tmpdir_factory.getbasetemp()
    print("base:", base_temp)

    # tmpdir already has a path name associated with it
    a_file = a_dir.join('something.txt')

    # we can create directories
    a_sub_dir = a_dir.mkdir('anything')

    # we can create files in directories (created when written)
    another_file = a_sub_dir.join('something_else.txt')

    # this write creates 'something.txt'
    a_file.write('contents may settle during shipping')

    # this write creates 'anything/something_else.txt'
    another_file.write('something different')

    # we can read files as well
    assert a_file.read() == 'contents may settle during shipping'
    assert another_file.read() == 'something different'
